- Github: [https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020)
- Piazza: [https://piazza.com/upenn/fall2020/musa550/home](https://piazza.com/upenn/fall2020/musa550/home)
- Canvas: [https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1533812](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1533812)

We will use Piazza for questions related to lecture materials and assignments,
while Canvas will be used for hosting recorded lectures and calendar invites for
Zoom lectures. The course's Github page will have repositories for each week's
lectures as well as assignments.

## Format

The course will be conducted in weekly sessions devoted to lectures, interactive
demonstrations, and in-class labs.

## Assignments

There is one required final project at the end of the semester, and you must
complete five of the seven homework assignments. Four of the assignments are
required, and you are allowed to choose the last assignment to complete (out of
the remaining three options). The required assignments are denoted by asterisks
below.

For the final project, students will replicate the pipeline approach on a
dataset (or datasets) of their choosing. Students will be required to use
several of the analysis techniques taught in the class and produce a web-based
data visualization that effectively communicates the empirical results to a
non-technical audience. The final product should also include a description of
the methods used in each step of the data science process (collection, analysis,
and visualization).

For more details on the final project, see [the Github
repository](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020/final-project).

## Grading

The grading breakdown is as follows: 50% for homework; 40% for final project,
10% for participation. Your participation grade will be determined
by your activity on Piazza — both asking, answering, and reading
questions.

Of the seven homework assignment, you must complete five in total and three are
required. Late homework will be accepted but penalized.

## Software

This course relies on use of Python and various related packages and for
geospatial topics. All software is open-source and freely available. The course
will require a working installation of Python on your local computer. See the
[Software Setup Guide](https://musa-550-fall-2020.github.io/setup) for
instructions on how to setup your computer for use in this course.

## Policies

## Communication Policies

- **Please add the following text into the subject line of emails to us:
  [MUSA550]**. This will help us make sure we don't miss your email!
- **We will use Piazza** for questions related to lecture material and assignments.
- To prevent code copying, please do not post long, complete code examples to Piazza.
- Anonymous posting is enabled on Piazza — if you have a question that requires
  a full code example, please use the anonymous feature to post the question.
- We will also use Piazza for announcements — please make sure your
  notifications are turned on and you check the website frequently. This will
  be the primary method of communication for course-wide announcements.
- If you have larger-scale or conceptual questions on assignments or lecture
  material, please set up a time to discuss during office hours.

## Group Work

Students are allowed (and encouraged!) to collaborate when working through
lecture materials or assignments. If you work closely with other students,
please list the members of your group at the top of your assignment.

## Special Accommodations

There are a number of ongoing situations in the world that may take precedence
over the course work. If you are experiencing any difficulties outside the
course, please [contact me](mailto:nhand@design.upenn.edu) and accommodations can be made.

The remote learning environment is also an unprecedented situation. If you
are having any difficulties with the course schedule, attending lectures, or similar,
please let us know.

## Expectations for Remote Lectures

Remote lectures will be via Zoom. Students will also be learning in different time zones.
With this in mind, the following are guidelines for attending lectures:

- Video is encouraged but certainly not required
- If not speaking, please mute yourself to limit feedback and echoes
- To ask a question, students can either "raise their hand" via the Zoom
  functionality, send the question via the chat functionality, or simply
  interrupt and ask during a pause

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to be familiar with and comply with Penn’s Code of
Academic Integrity, which is available in the Pennbook, or online at
[https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity).
